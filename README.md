## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, 
run `bundle exec rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an 
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then 
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, 
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Running Tests

Run all tests via `bundle exec rake`. To run private tests only:

```bash
bundle exec rake TEST=test/private_test.rb 
```

Due to Security and Privacy, most of the test cases are private. You can find
example private tests under `test/` folder.

## TODO

- `add_new_monitor` will have more options/features...
